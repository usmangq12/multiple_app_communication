## Multiple App Communication 

This app  is a React and Redux-based application framework that allows for the dynamic loading and integration of multiple internal  React applications within a single interface. It provides a common menu and view panel, which can be dynamically updated and configured to load and manage different application components seamlessly.

## Features
Dynamic Menu System: A UI component that displays a common dropdown w
View Panel for Internal  Applications: A view panel where intenral React applications can be loaded dynamically based on selection.

Dynamic UI Component Loading: The application can load UI components dynamically based on a selection  asset that specifies the version of the component, such as ProfileForm  v1 and  ProfileForm v2.
Inter-Application Communication: Dynamically loaded applications can interact with each other using Redux, without the need for direct communication, facilitating a modular and decoupled architecture.
